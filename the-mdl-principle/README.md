# The MDL Principle

This directory provides the essential background needed to understand and apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. It is organized into two parts:

- [**./theory**](./theory/) &mdash; Introduces the key concepts and conceptual background of description length and its role in the MDL principle.
- [**./notebooks**](./notebooks) &mdash; Provides interactive Jupyter notebooks with working examples and implementations that illustrate the ideas in practice.

Together, these materials supply a minimal but sufficient foundation for understanding the MDL principle and how it can be applied to model selection in machine learning.
