# Coding Theory Concepts for the MDL Principle

This directory provides the essential background in coding theory needed to understand and apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. It is organized into two complementary parts:

- [**./theory**](./theory) &mdash; Introduces the key concepts and conceptual background of coding theory.  
- [**./notebooks**](./notebooks) &mdash; Provides interactive Jupyter notebooks with working examples and implementations.  

These materials supply a minimal working foundation for connecting coding theory to the MDL principle.
